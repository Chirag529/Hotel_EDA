## Introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in understanding your data before diving into more advanced analytics. In this project, we explore a hotel booking dataset, perform data preprocessing, and visualize key insights to inform decision-making.


## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the [Hotel booking demand datasets - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191). It contains information about hotel bookings, including reservation details, guest demographics, and booking outcomes.


## Analysis Highlights
- Identification of top countries with the highest number of customers.
- Analysis of booking cancellations by market segment.
- Visualization of room prices by room type and hotel.
- Seasonal analysis of hotel bookings.
- Examination of accommodation type distribution.
- Guest count analysis by month and year.
- ... and much more!

## Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values in the dataset.
- Converting data types to appropriate formats.
- Cleaning column names for consistency.
- Removing records with no guests.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
We performed exploratory data analysis to understand various aspects of hotel bookings, such as customer demographics, booking patterns, and cancellation rates.

## Data Visualization
We created informative visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to provide a clearer understanding of the data. Visualizations include bar charts, box plots, and line graphs.

## Conclusion
The Hotel EDA project provides valuable insights into hotel bookings, including guest preferences, booking trends, and cancellation patterns. This analysis can be used by hotel management to make informed decisions and improve their services.
